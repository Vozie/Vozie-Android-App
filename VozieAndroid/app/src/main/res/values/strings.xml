    <string name="about_company">Vozie Inc. is a pre-paid ride sharing service HQd out of San Jose California located in the heart of the Silicon Valley. Vozie began as a garage start up in September of 2015. The idea was brought up due to the high surcharges and price increases when using ride sharing services during high peak hours. The Vozie team has made it our mission to provide an option that will be consistent and not gauge people that depend on ride sharing to get around.</string>
    <string name="about_company2">Vozie has grown into a four person team that has worked extensively to provide the best solution in the marketplace. Two members of the team are in charge of developing the product for the android app and will be making the app available for the ios.</string>
